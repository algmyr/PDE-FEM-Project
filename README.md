A PDE FEM project
=================

A set of MATLAB-files for simulating the wave function using the finite element method.
The simulation is interactive (read the code for instructions) and some
non-interactive demos showing interference exists. A sample mesh made for the
demos is saved in a .mat file in InterferenceDemo/.
